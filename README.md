Flutter Bond is the public One Studio's template for all internal Flutter apps. You are welcome to use this template for your project as well and contribute to make it even better.

This is a Work In Progress mini framework inspired by Clean Architecture, lessons learned from past projects, and ideas from the Laravel ecosystem.


# About Flutter Bond

Flutter Bond is a mobile application framework built on top of Flutter with expressive, simplified architecture. Our aim is to make development not just easier but also fun. With Flutter Bond, you can focus more on building features rather than worrying about boilerplate code. Some of the core features are:

- Seamless state management.
- Simplified API calls with Bond Fire.
- Easy navigation and routing.
- Extensible architecture with Bond Core.
- CLI support for faster development with Bond CLI.

Flutter Bond is scalable, flexible, and designed to build robust, high-quality applications.
